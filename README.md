This repository contains the source for MessageBird Firebase Extensions. 

Each directory in this repo contains the source code for the extension and a README to explain how the extension works, including information about the APIs enabled, resources created, and the access granted to the extension.

When you find an extension that solves a need for your app or project, all you do is install and configure the extension. With extensions, you don't spend time researching, writing, and debugging the code that implements functionality or automates a task for your app or project. Each extension has PREINSTALL/POSTINSTALL with additional actions that you will need to take before/after installing the extension.

This extensions are based on examples from [Firebase Official Extensions](https://github.com/firebase/extensions) sources.
